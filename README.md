## 👋 About Me

I'm a mathematician and machine learning engineer, focused on building robust, data-driven systems for medical applications. My work spans applied ML, statistical modeling, time series segmentation, and software infrastructure for data-heavy applications. I enjoy designing tools that are not only effective but also maintainable and intuitive to use.

🔗 Blog: https://www.probableodyssey.blog/ — I write about machine learning, software engineering, and the occasional mathematical curiosity.

🔧 Tools & Interests

- 🧠 Machine Learning · 🔍 NLP · 📊 Time Series · 🖼️ Image Analysis
- 🐍 Python · ⚙️ PyTorch · 🐘 PostgreSQL · 🐳 Docker · ☁️ GCP & AWS
- 📈 Data pipelines · 🧪 Experimentation frameworks · 🛠️ MLOps
- 🧵 I'm also interested in Julia, dynamical systems, and stochastic processes.

🎯 Currently exploring self-hosted LLMs, privacy-focused ML pipelines, and ways to make scientific computing more efficient and accessible.

📍 Based in the inner city. Powerlifter. Likes chaos (theoretical and practical).

💚 Charity Support
